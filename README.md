This data project aims to predict the prices for rental houses in Nairobi County.
Various house details are used to make the machine learning model to predict the prices.

These features are:

- ***Bathrooms*** -  this represents the number of bathrooms present in the house.
- ***Parking*** - this represents the number of parking slots that a tenant can have.
- ***Price*** - this represents the house rent price of the house.

Before building the machine model of the house, we first analye the data to gain insights from the data on the houses in Nairobi.
This will help us understand which types of houses are more common in Nairobi, why prices in a certain location is capped where it is,
where you can find the cheapest house with the features you want and many other valuable insights from the data.
